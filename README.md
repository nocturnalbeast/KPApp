# KPApp - A career guidance application

A simple Android app that I made for a friend.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Install Android Studio, Android SDK and the JDK if you want to continue with this crappy project xD.

Then, download or clone this repository to get started with development.

Open the project in Android Studio after extracting the root folder somewhere you prefer. Then you're good to go!
